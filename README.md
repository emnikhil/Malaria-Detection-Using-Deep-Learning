# Malaria-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
A Convolutional Neural Network algorithm designed to detect malaria using cell images.
In order to run the trained model 
Load the model directly in the Jupyter-Notebook or the Spyder Notebbok and then test the image you want to determine whether the sample has Malaria or not.
Accuracy Achieved - 99%
